# 🌉 BostonBridge Hackathon 2024 at UMass Boston

Welcome to the repository for the 🚀 BostonBridge Hackathon 2024, hosted by the Computer Science Club at UMass Boston. This event is dedicated to addressing the unique challenges faced by commuter students at UMass Boston, with a focus on better integrating them into city life.

## 📝 Executive Summary

UMass Boston, predominantly a commuter school, presents unique challenges for students in terms of commuting, housing, employment, and finding leisure activities. The computer science community at UMB also has a lot of room for growth. This hackathon aims to increase the involvement of CS students in campus events while collaboratively solving student-specific issues.

## 🎯 Hackathon Theme
